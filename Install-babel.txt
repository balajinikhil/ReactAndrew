In order to run the babel command, you need to either install babel globaly or run it from package.json by saving it in scripts

scripts: {
   babelCmd: "babel src/app.js --out-file=public/scripts/app.js --presets=env,react --watch"
}
and run using

npm run babelCmd
If you want to run the babel command directly, you need to install like

npm install -g babel-cli babel-preset-react
